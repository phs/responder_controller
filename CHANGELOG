*ResponderController 0.3.0*

* Broke modules out into separate files.
* Actions#index calls #to_a on @models before passing to #respond_with.  This
  makes rails 3.0.0beta3 happy: otherwise "object references itself" errors
  would occur in the json encoder.

*ResponderController 0.2.0*

* Added .serves_scopes, which takes :only and :except options to restrict the
  list of active record scopes that #index will serve.  If a forbidden scope
  is requested, ForbiddenScope will be raised, which will render as a 403 if
  uncaught.

*ResponderController 0.1.3*

* Render BadScopes as 400s, not 422s

*ResponderController 0.1.2*

* If a requested scope errors out, raise a BadScope exception.  Tell rails (if
  present) to render these as 422s.

*ResponderController 0.1.1*

* Use AR#scoped instead of #all to create initial query, as #all gives a
  literal array (whoops.)
